# Travis Bergsgaard

Builder. 40+ projects, 3,160+ commits, and a full ecosystem of tools across Bitcoin infrastructure, AI security, legal tech, publishing, and autonomous development.

I build systems that solve real problems — AI-native from day one. Everything here ships.

Founder of [Empowered Humanity](https://github.com/empowered-humanity) — AI security tooling for defense and critical infrastructure.

## Areas of Focus

### Bitcoin Infrastructure & Circular Economies
Open-source tooling that lets any community deploy a private Bitcoin circular economy — Fedimint federation, Cashu ecash mints, Lightning L402 commerce rails — from a single prompt. Non-custodial by design, privacy by default. Currently piloting in Longmont, CO.
> Open source: [arxmint](https://github.com/Traviseric/arxmint)

### AI Orchestration & Autonomous Development
Systems that run fleets of AI agents to build, audit, and ship software autonomously. 75+ modular execution boxes, parallel workers, multi-account failover, and production readiness pipelines. The orchestration layer builds and maintains my other projects.
> Open source: [teneo-agent](https://github.com/Traviseric/teneo-agent)

### AI Security & Trust
176-pattern agent security scanner with taint analysis, context flow tracing, and OWASP ASI + MCP coverage. Alongside that — a full AI trust stack for quality scoring, PII/PHI detection, GDPR/HIPAA/CCPA compliance scanning, and fact verification. 818 tests, 96.5% coverage, deployed to production.
> Open source: [agent-security](https://github.com/empowered-humanity/agent-security) · [crypto-toolkit](https://github.com/empowered-humanity/crypto-toolkit)

### Parallel Content Generation
160+ Lambda functions on AWS Step Functions generating long-form content concurrently across multiple AI models. Context assembly, quality evaluation, rewriting pipelines — full distributed architecture with React frontend and Stripe billing.

### Behavioral Detection & Anti-Bot Intelligence
22-signal detection engine modeling human mouse dynamics (Bezier curves, Fitts' law), keyboard timing (AR(1) inter-key intervals, digraph patterns), and scroll behavior. Adversarial Red vs Blue game controller for continuous self-improvement.

### Legal Intelligence
Court document generation, financial forensics (Benford analysis, structuring detection), judge analytics, and RAG pipelines for case law — wired through a conversational AI system with 10 specialized missions.

## Background

Before code, I built and ran businesses. Published 250+ books through a company with a team of 21 writers. Scaled a photography studio to $25K/month with a 20x return on ad spend. I've always built systems — AI gave me a new medium and I went deep.
